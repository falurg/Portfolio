## Machine Learning
| Link | Tools | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [Analyzing IMDb Movie Reviews for Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/falurg/Portfolio/blob/main/IMDB%20Sentiment%20Analysis/movie_reviews.ipynb) | Python (Pandas, MatPlotLib, NLTK, WordCloud, Scikit-learn), JupyterLab | In this sentiment analysis project, we aimed to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. After performing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and training a logistic regression model using a bag-of-words representation, we achieved an accuracy of 88.74%. The model demonstrated balanced precision, recall, and F1-score for both sentiment classes, indicating its effectiveness in classifying movie reviews. |
| [Forecasting Iceland: Weather Insights](https://github.com/falurg/Portfolio/blob/main/Iceland%20Weather%20Data/weather_data.ipynb) | Python (Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib, statsmodels), JupyterLab  | I undertook a project centered around time series analysis and forecasting of weather data in Reykjavik, Iceland. The project involved analyzing historical weather patterns and utilizing the SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) model to predict future temperature trends. By applying advanced modeling techniques, the project aimed to gain insights into the region's weather patterns and contribute to improved forecasting accuracy. |
